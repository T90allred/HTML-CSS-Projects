        <h2>About me</h2>
          <p class="main-content"><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text
          of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
          Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
          text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
          printer took a galley of type and scrambled
          it to make a type specimen book. It has
          survived not only five centuries, but also
          the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
          essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
          1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
          Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
          publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
          including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
